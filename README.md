# COMP0034 Week 5 course material

This a repository of materials that support the Moodle activities for week 4. It is not intended for use as a standalone
repository.

The data is from the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk). The charts mimic those displayed in the Environment
section of the London Datastore website.

The exercises in this week make use of the dash-bootstrap-components library for CSS.

The exercises were inspired by, and use and adapt code from, the
article [How to embed Bootstrap CSS & JS in your Python Dash app](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-embed-bootstrap-css-js-in-your-python-dash-app-8d95fc9e599e)
. The article also uses machine learning to forecast which we are not covering in this course.

## Setup

By now you should know how to do the following, if not please refer to the instructions from earlier weeks of the course
or use the online documentation from your IDE.

1. Copy the repository from the GitHub classroom link in Moodle week 5.
2. Clone the repository in your chosen IDE.
3. Create a venv in the repository directory.
4. Install the requirements from requirements.txt.

There is no Flask app this week so you do not need to check the Flask configuration.

## Completed example (use with caution)
There is a completed example of the activities in the repo nicholons/comp0034_week5_complete. 
This is not intended as an exemplar and is only one possible solution to the challenges. 
It has 'TODO's and may have errors!
